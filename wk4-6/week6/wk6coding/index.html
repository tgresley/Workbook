            <h1>AI visualisation</h1>
            <p>For this activity, I took the live coding done in class and asked OpenAI to make it as crazy as possible. I was interested to see how the AI would re-visualise the code data I gave it and respond to my prompt: "rewrite this code making it insane, adding as many elements as possible." I don’t think it did a very good job, but it challenges the specificity embedded in the collection of data—how was it supposed to know what I (as constructed through the 'data' I collect) meant by 'insane'?</p>

<p>In creating the landing page for this week's content, I learnt so many new skills. With the help of OpenProcessing, the coding of an interactive data map with connecting nodes and edges was able to sit above a simple sketch of combined shape masking a random image. This code took me hours to get to work, but I think it is reflective of the content that I explored this week. The song I used is one of my childhood favourites and is indicative of the visualisation of data. </p>
